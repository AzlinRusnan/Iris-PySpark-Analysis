# Iris-PySpark-Analysis

# Iris Classification with PySpark

This project demonstrates how to perform classification on the Iris dataset using Spark MLlib. The steps include loading the dataset, splitting it into training and testing sets, selecting and tuning a classification algorithm, evaluating the model, and conducting a comparative analysis between predicted labels and actual labels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark
- PySpark library
- pandas library (if using visualization)
- seaborn library (if using visualization)
- matplotlib library (if using visualization)

### Installing

1. **Install Python and Spark:**

   - Python: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Spark: Download and install Apache Spark from [spark.apache.org](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html)

2. **Install PySpark:**

   ```sh
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf
    from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, VectorAssembler
    from pyspark.ml.classification import RandomForestClassifier
    from pyspark.ml.evaluation import MulticlassClassificationEvaluator
    from pyspark.ml.tuning import CrossValidator, ParamGridBuilder
   ```

### Explanation

- **Markdown Formatting**: Use triple backticks (\`\`\`) to denote blocks of code. Specify the language (e.g., `python`) for syntax highlighting.
- **Sections**: Include sections such as Getting Started, Installing, Running the Code, PySpark Code, Results, and Conclusion to organize your README file.
- **Code Blocks**: Add your PySpark code inside a code block to ensure it is properly formatted and easy to read.

This README structure helps users understand how to set up and run your project, and it provides clear documentation of your PySpark code and its results.
